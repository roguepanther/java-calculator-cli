This is a Java CLI Calculator, built from scratch without external resources.  
It helped me learn:
- Java basics
- Methods (`void` vs `return`)
- `switch` statements
- `while` loops
- User input via `Scanner`
- **Exception handling** like a pro 💥

## 🧠 Future Plans

1. Improve input validation (e.g. catch non-integer input)

2. Add support for decimal numbers

3. Include history of calculations

4. Build a GUI version with Swing or JavaFX later down the line
